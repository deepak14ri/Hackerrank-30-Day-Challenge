Sample Input

The following input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor:
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
The

subsequent lines of test cases each contain an integer to be inserted at the list's tail.

4
2
3
4
1

Sample Output

The locked code in your editor prints the ordered data values for each element in your list as a single line of space-separated integers:

2 3 4 1
